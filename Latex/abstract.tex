We have a real dataset related to \textit{Opportunistic Cardiometabolic} Screening. The goal is to exploit the dataset collected for the mentioned reason to predict other clinical outcomes and measure biological age using incidental data that typically goes unused/underuse â€“ this includes clinical data and Computerized Tomography (CT) data. For the context of this project, we have predicted death, diabetes and heart-attack and derived biological age.
